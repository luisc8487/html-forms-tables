# Forms & Tables in HTML

### Overview 
This project demonstrates the use of **HTML forms and tables** with various input types, validation, and proper label associations. The form includes elements such as:

- Different input types (text, email, password, range, textarea, select dropdown, etc.)
- Labels properly connected to their respective inputs using the `for` attribute.
- Input validation with `required`, `maxlength`, and `minlength` attributes. 
- A range input functioning as a slider.
- A section where users can search Google, Reddit, and YouTube directly from the form.
